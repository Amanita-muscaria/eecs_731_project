## The effects of government policies on COVID-19

For our final project, we wanted to investigate the impact that government policies had on the spread of COVID-19. The main questions we investigated were:

1. How long after the implementation of policies do we see a downturn in the growth of COVID cases? 
1. Cluster countries into good response/ok response/bad response. Did the country draft enough effective policies to slow the growth of the virus?
1. Plot number of policies and total cases per country. Does having more policies help have a lower number of cases? Effects of different types of policies 
1. In the US, do mask wearing habits impact the spread of COVID-19? (regression)
1. How did COVID-19 impact the rate of mental health issues in the US?
1. How did COVID-19 impact the rate of bankruptcy filings in the US?
1. How did COVID-19 policies affect the rate of CO2 emissions worldwide?
