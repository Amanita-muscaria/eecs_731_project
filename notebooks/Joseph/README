The three notebooks available in this file include the main workup of the OWID COVID-19 database and the Coronanet policy in the forms  of "OWID Covid data cleanup and exploratory analysis" and of "Coronanet Policy exploration" respectively. The third notebook titled "OWID Corona and Coronanet policy for policy scatterplot" is the workbook used in the workup of the data and figures that I presented in the presentation.
