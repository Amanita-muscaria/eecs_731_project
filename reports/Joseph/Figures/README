Note: the figures present in this folder are those that were used in the presentation. The figure files were named using the 3-digit ISO code for each country analyzed (CHN = China, IND = India, USA = United States). The "_different_types"-labelled figures show the amounts of the different types of policies, while the other version just denotes the raw number of policies with no typing.
